One of the files that is used as input by NgonorrhoeaeLinkageGenomics.pl is named:
>NgonorrhoeaeFA1090_NmeningitidisAlpha14_AlleleTable.txt

and is essentially a reformatted version of the output from the program 
progressiveMauve that is easier to parse for downstream analyses. This subdirectory
contains the necessary script to recompute this table, using a reference genome
named:

>NgonorrhoeaeFA1090_genomic.fna

along with the output of progressiveMauve, named:

>NgonorrhoeaeFA1090_NmeningitidisAlpha14_progMauve.alignment

This alignment was produced by aligning the N. gonorrhoeae FA1090 reference 
sequence with the N. meningitidis Alpha14 reference sequence.
